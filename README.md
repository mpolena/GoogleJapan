# GoogleJapan

A friend of mine, during a coding interview with google Japan, was asked to come up with an algorithm 
for checking whether the integers in a list would form one or more straights.

After being intoduced to the problem, here's the algorithm I came up with.

Changes were made to the original implementation to allow user to enter a list of intergers via
the command line.
